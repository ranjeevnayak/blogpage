# blogpage

hii mam as per your instruction i made changes in that webpage.
I display the data entered by the user in a nice format after he presses submit
i used php so that you need wampserver for that to open the project.
then you will open blogpage.html and fill the data after press enter you will see values print on next page display.php
before enter the values you have to import intern.sql file in wamp server so that the database will work correctly.
